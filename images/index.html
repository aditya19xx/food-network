            <h1>Our Recipies</h1>
            <p>Chinese food in Bangladesh is nothing like the regional cuisines of China. Bangladeshis have made it
                their own by
                creating lip-smacking dishes packed with spicy flavours.Perhaps one of the most vibrant and evocative
                books about the food of China is Shark's Fin and Sichuan Pepper: A Sweet-Sour Memoir of Eating in China
                by Fuchsia Dunlop, who spent many years of her life in China</p>

            <h2>Daal</h2>
            <p>Dal (also spelled dhal or daal) is one of the most versatile, healthy, filling, and delicious meals. Dal
                translates to lentil, but when referred to in the context of food it means a spiced Indian lentil soup.

            <h2>Mutton Steak</h2>
            <p>Using vinaigrette as a sauce for grilled meats is one of my favorite 'cheats' of all time. They take
                minutes to whisk together, there's absolutely no culinary finesse required, and the combinations of
                oils, vinegar, and flavorings are limitless.</p>
